Welcome to the MIRA chatbot web experiment! Your feedback is crucial for helping us build a supportive and effective tool for caregivers.

**Your task is to try out both chatbot personas and compare your experience.**

1.  **Select a Persona:** Use the radio button below to choose either the **Warm** or **Clinical** chatbot.
2.  **Ask Questions:** In the chat box, ask questions related to the challenges of caregiving for a person with dementia (PWD).
    * *Examples:* "My mother keeps wandering, what should I do?" or "I'm feeling burnt out from caregiving, can you help?"
3.  **Engage with Each Bot:** For each persona, you need to have a continuous conversation with a **minimum of 10 prompts** before switching.
4.  **Observe the Difference:** Pay close attention to the **tone** and **style** of the responses.
    * **Warm Bot:** Should feel empathetic, supportive, and conversational.
    * **Clinical Bot:** Should be direct, factual, and professional.
5.  **Start a New Conversation:** Use the 'Start New Conversation' button to reset the chat and try the other persona.

### **Your Role as a Tester: Providing Feedback**

After trying both chatbots, please reflect on the following:

**Which chatbot would you be more inclined to use for ongoing support, and why?**

Think about which one you found more trustworthy, helpful, and comfortable to interact with. Your qualitative feedback on this is essential for our study. Thank you for your valuable time and insights!
